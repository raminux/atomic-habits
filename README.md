# Atomic Habits

In this repository, I try to summarize the `Atomic Habits` book and also add some other points regarding habit formation from other resources. 

Also, I am going to implement the instructions provided in that book to form powerful habits in all aspects of my life as provided by `Life Book` program as follows
1. Health & Fitness
2. Intellectual Life
3. Emotional Life
4. Spiritual Life
5. Character
6. Love Relationship
7. Parenting
8. Social Life
9. Career
10. Financial Life
11. Quality of Life
12. Life Vision. 

I believe that the productivity of my life depends on the quality of my habits. In my opinion, habits are the roots of the life tree. Cultivating strong habits through different aspects of life will result in a fruitful and productive life.
