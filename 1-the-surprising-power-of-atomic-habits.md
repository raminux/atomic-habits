# The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits 
What made `Brailsford` different from other coaches of the British cycling team was his ==relentless commitment== to a strategy that he referred to as **the aggregation of marginal gains,** which is the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do. 
> This philosophy is what turns an ordinary person into an extraordinary one. 

## Why Small Habits Make A BiG Difference
Small improvements accumulates to make a massive success over time. 

Habits are the compound interest of self-improvements. 

> Habits seem to have no difference on a given day and yet the impact they deliver over months and years can be enormous. It can not be seen at the momemnt but only three or 5 years later. 

==The results we are seeking for never seem to come quickly, this is the point that we must continue. Persistancy is the key!==

> `James` points to a very crucial concept:
***Succes is the product of daily habits--not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.***
>- This is an amazing quote. Daily improvements are vital to success. Success is not an event, it is a process! We get what we repeat. 

## What Progress Is Really Like
- Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. 
- Bamboo tree can barely be seen for the first five years as it buils extensive root systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within six weeks. 
- Habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance.
- Habits need to persist long enough to break through ==the plateau of latent potential.==
- `Plateau` is a state of little or no change following a period of activity or progress!

I recall a sentence that highly similar to what `James` states in this section of his book. The quote is:
**==When you get tired, continue one more step!==**
In other words, when you think that you are not progressing, you are at the plateau of latent potential. At this state, you just need to move forward one step ahead. That is the point!

## The Plateau of Latent Potential
- Start small and amateur and grow bigger and bigger. 
> The seed of every habit is a single, tiny decision. But as that decision is repeated, a habit sprouts and grows stronger. 

There are two important questions that need to be investigated and answered in order to be able to cultivate good habits and uproot the bad ones:
1. What determines whether we stick with a habit long enough to survive the Plateau of Latent Potential and break through to the other side?
2. What is it that causes some people to slide into unwanted habits and enables others to enjoy the compounding effects of good ones?

## Forget about goals, Focus on systems instead
> - ==Goals== are about the results you want to achieve, while ==Systems== are about the **Processes** that lead to those results. 
> I see a great insight in this sentence. It strongly states that what determines my success is the habit of success. In other words, by having a good set of habits, I equipe myself with those systems that lead to my end goals seamlessly. I need to cultivate more and more of these processes to be able to grow and shine with focus. 
> The only way to win is to get better each day. 

- So, I have to fix my system. Then the result takes care of itself! This is true in any areas of life. Focus on system not goal!

- Goals are good just for setting the direction, otherwise if they take more of our attention than what the system needs, the following problems will arise:
1. Winners and losers have the same goals. 
Winners have a system of continuous small improvements, while losers don't!

2. Achieving a goal is only a momentary change. 
Being tidy and clean always is different from cleaning the room every week. 

3. Goals restrict your happiness.
Either you have to enjoy the process or enjoy the result. Enjoying the process means living with great happiness every moment of my life. Goals restric happiness and delay it until achieving it! That's not fun!

4. Goals are at odds with long-term progress. 
Build the system and win the game of life, or set a goal and win once!
Commit to the process and your success is guaranteed!

## A System of Atomic Habits
- If I want to change my habits, I need to change my system! By changing my system, I am able to remove bad habits and add good oned instead. This process is done step by step with easy, enjoyable, and powerful atomic routines. Let's do it!
