# The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits 
What made `Brailsford` different from other coaches of the British cycling team was his ==relentless commitment== to a strategy that he referred to as **the aggregation of marginal gains,** which is the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do. 
> This philosophy is what turns an ordinary person into an extraordinary one. 

## Why Small Habits Make A BiG Difference
Small improvements accumulates to make a massive success over time. 

Habits are the compound interest of self-improvements. 

> Habits seem to have no difference on a given day and yet the impact they deliver over months and years can be enormous. It can not be seen at the momemnt but only three or 5 years later. 

==The results we are seeking for never seem to come quickly, this is the point that we must continue. Persistancy is the key!==

> `James` points to a very crucial concept:
***Succes is the product of daily habits--not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.***
>- This is an amazing quote. Daily improvements are vital to success. Success is not an event, it is a process! We get what we repeat. 

## What Progress Is Really Like
- Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. 
- Bamboo tree can barely be seen for the first five years as it buils extensive root systems undergroung before exploding ninety feet into the air within six weeks. 
- Habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance.
- Habits need to persist long enough to break through ==the plateau of latent potential.==
- `Plateau` is a state of little or no change following a period of activity or progress!

I recall a sentence that highly similar to what `James` states in this section of his book. The quote is:
**==When you get tired, continue one more step!==**
In other words, when you think that you are not progressing, you are at the plateau of latent potential. At this state, you just need to move forward one step ahead. That is the point!
