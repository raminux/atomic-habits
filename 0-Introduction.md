# Introduction

As for `James Clear`, I feel it is going to be a new beginning for me because I'm going to use the surprising power of small habits for the first time persistantly.

`James` points out an important idea as:
- "Those minor improvements (building good sleep habits and keeping my room neat and tidy) gave me a sense of control over my life." 

That's an interesting result. Forming good habits make me feel that the control of life is in my hands.

A habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly-and, in many cases, automatically. 

Let's talk about the following sentence:
- "But it was not until my senior season that my sleep habits, study habits, and strength-training habits really began to pay off."
As it is clear, it takes time for a habit to form, and some extra time to be benefited from that habit. So, I must start a habit and persist in it until I reach the results I want. This analysis yields to the following sentence:
- "...changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you're willing to stick with them for years..."

The quality of my life depends on the quality of my habits. 

Start small and gradually evolve.
- **The only choice that I have is to start small!**
- **I'm going to start my business SMALL!**

Start to experiment alongside your readers. That is an extremely powerful technique to keep on good work and be motivated to do more and more. 

The four-step model of habits is:
- cue, 
- craving, 
- response, 
- reward. 

The step-by-step system provided by `James` can be applied to health, money, productivity, relationships, and many more. This is fantastic!
